								<h3> CBA WIZARDS </h3>
								<p> Wizards are small group of beings outwardly resembling men but possessing much greater physical and mental power. They are also called the ISTARI (wise ones) by the mythical elves. A CBA wizard is a practitioner of, especially in, business and accountancy. A helpful folk magician they provide the main means of neutralizing enemies who thought of themselves as more superior than CBA wizard. <br>
								Colloquially anyone who is especially adept at some obscure or difficult business or accounting endeavor and who belongs under the College of Business and Accountancy, Gordon College, may be referred to as a CBA Wizard, magic is not a talent but a deliberate rewarding art of science superior power and intelligence. </p>

								<h3>CCS PHOENIX</h3>
								<p> Phoenix, known as the mythical bird that never die, flies far ahead to the front, always scanning the landscape and distant space. It represents our capacity for vision, for collecting sensory information about our environment and the events unfolding within it.  The Phoenix, with its great beauty, creates excitement and deathless inspiration. <br>
								In Chinese mythology, the Phoenix is the symbol of high virtue and grace, power and prosperity. It represents the union of yin and yang. It was thought to be a gentle creature, so gentle that it crushed nothing, and eating only dewdrops.  Its body symbolizes the six celestial bodies.  The head is the sky, the eyes are the sun, the back is the moon, the wings are the wind, the feet are the earth, and the tail is the planets. Its feathers contain the five fundamental colors: black, white, red, green, and yellow and was said to represent the Confucian virtues of loyalty, honesty, decorum and justice. </p>

							<img src="logo/LOGO.png" id="logoCHAS" style="max-width:45%;"/> 
								<h3> CAHS TIGERS </h3>
								<p>White Tigers are magnificent creatures that possess an amazing combination of spectacular beauty and impressing power. Bengal tigers, as they are sometimes called, have blue eyes, pink nose, and creamy white fur covered with stripes of chocolate color. <br>
								White tiger range in length between 8.8 to 10.2 feet. They weigh 419 and 569 pounds on the average. Females are smaller, and range in length from 7.11 to 8.7 feet, weighing around 350 pounds. <br>
								White tigers are very rare animals. They are seen only in zoos nowadays. These animals are sometimes mistakenly considered to be albino species of tiger. However, it is not true to fact. White tiger occurs when both tigers that mate carry the gene for white coloring. A white tiger’s tail reaches the length of 3 to 4 feet. </p>

								<h3> CEAS MENTORS </h3>
								<p>In Greek mythology, Mentors (sometimes Mentes) was the son of Alcumus and, in his old age, a friend of Odysseus. When Odysseus left for the Trojan War, he placed Mentors in charge of his son, Telamachus, and of his place. When Athena visited Telemachus she took the disguise of Mentor to hide herself from Telemachus "mother" suitor.  This is the source of the modern use of the word mentor: a trusted friend, a counselor or a teacher, usually a more experienced person. <br>
								The College of Education, true to its mission, aims to produce multicultural, well-trained, dynamic and competitive teachers. Such mission shall consequently produce well-rounded mentors! <br>
								The mentor is represented by a knight, who, during the middle age served as a teacher among the sons of kings and queens and of the nobilities. The knight is the person recognized by the society as one who has displayed great virtue. The knight is an honored man, and he claims the title "Sir", usually regardless of gender.<br>
								The College of Education, Arts and Sciences, during the annual Sports Festival from this year onward, is very proud to be known as MENTORS- your knights, your teachers, your friend! </p>

						<p>IBF Rules will be implemented. <br>
						<b>Toss: </b> 
						<br>The winner of the toss can elect to serve or receive in the first game, or to choose to play particular end of the court. The loser of the toss makes the remaining choice.<br>
						<b>Basic Aim:</b> <br>
							You win a rally if you hit the shuttle over the net and onto the floor of the opposing side’s court. You lose the rally if you hit the shuttle into the net, or over the net but outside of the opposing side’s court. You also lose the rally if, for example, the shuttle touches you or your clothing, or if you hit before it crosses the net.<br>

						<b>Serving:</b> <br> The service courts are slightly different for singles and doubles. A shuttle on the line is “in”. The server and receiver stand in the diagonally opposite service counts (always right hand at the start of the game) but therefore players may move anywhere on their side of the net.  The server must obey laws designed to force underhand delivery of the serve, and the receiver must stand still until the service is struck.
						Scoring: 30 – point system for elimination and for 3rd and 4th placer, no setting at 29 all, 21-point system, rally point system will be followed for championship. </p>

						<p>Official International Rules for "Regu" Sepak Takraw (Playing 3 on 3) Excerpts from Current rules* with amendments approved by ISTAF in Bangkok, Thailand, July 2, 2007 </p>

						<br>
						<p>GENERAL <br>
						In the event of any question or any matter arising out of any point, which is not expressly provided for in any of the rules of the game, the decision of the Official Referee shall be final. </p>


						<br>
						<p>THE PLAYERS <br>
						A match is played by two “Regus”, each consisting of three players. (3 main players and 2 reserve) <br>
						One of the three players shall be near the back of the court and he is called a "Tekong" (Server). <br>
						The other two players shall be in front, closer to the net, one on the left side of the Tekong and the other on the right side. The player on the left is called a "Left Forward" and the player on the right is called a "Right Forward". </p>

						<br> <br> <p>SUBSTITUTION <br>
						There shall be no repeat of the same player in any "Team Event" competition involving more than one regu.<br>
						Substitution of a player is allowed at any time on request made by the Team Manager or Coach to the Official Referee when the ball is not in play.<br>
						Each “Regu” may nominate none to maximum of two reserve players, BUT CAN MAKE ONLY ONE SUBSTITUTION IN A MATCH.<br> </p>
							
						<br> <br> <p>POSITION OF PLAYERS DURING SERVICE <br>

						At the start of play, the players of both regus must be in their respective courts in a ready position.<br>
						The "Tekong" shall be standing with one of his/her feet inside the serving circle.
						Both of the “Forward” players of the serving side must be standing in their respective quarter circles.<br>
						The opponent or receiving regu is free to be anywhere within its court. <br> </p>

						<br> <br> <p>THE START OF PLAY AND SERVICE <br>
						The Regu that serves first (according to the toss decision) shall start the first set. The side that wins the first set shall begin serving in the second set. <br>
						The throw or pitch of the Takraw ball from "Forward" player to the "Tekong" must be executed as soon as the Referee calls the score. If a Forward player throws the ball to the Tekong to serve before the Referee calls the score, it must be re-thrown and a warning will be given to the Regu. A repetition of this act will be considered a "Fault". <br>
						During the service, as soon as the Tekong kicks the ball, all players are allowed to move around freely in their respective courts.<br>
						The service is valid if the ball passes over the net, whether it touches the net or not, and inside the boundary of the two net tapes and boundary lines of the opponent’s court – as long as even the shadow of the ball (very outer edge) is directly over the tape or boundary line, it is considered in bounds.<br>
						In a Team Event Game during a Knock-out Style Tournament, if a winner is already decided at the end of the first two Matches, the losing Team is not obligated to play a third Match with their third Regu. </p>

						<br>LET’S offer this opportunity to many. Let’s allow and support others to flourish in dancing. Let’s now limit dancing to few and to costs that others usually think of. <br> <br>

						SELECTION OF GC SPORTS<br><br>

						CRITERIA FOR JUDGING <br>
						A.	TIMING AND BASIC RHYTHM <br>
						The judge must determine whether the couple is dancing in time and observing the basic rhythm. Dancing in time means that a step is taken neither prior to nor after the beat, but on the beat. <br> <br>

						B.	BODY LINES <br>
						The term body lines relate to the couple as a whole. These include: <br>
						Arm lines	Neck and Head Lines <br>
						Back lines	Right and left side lines <br>
						Shoulder lines<br>
						Hip lines (pelvic) <br>
						Leg lines <br> <br>

						C.	MOVEMENT<br>
						The judge must determine whether the movement is in keeping with the character of the dance and assesses the rise and fall, swing and balance of the couple. A greater swing only justifies better marking if the movement is controlled and balanced.<br> <br>

						D.	RHYTHMIC INTERPRETATION <br>
						The judge must assess the rhythmic interpretation of the dance. This reveals the capacity of the artistic choreography and the musical involvement of the couple in the dance. A change of rhythm to suit the music incurs a danger of timing errors which must be judged in the timing and basic rhythm. <br> <br>

						E.	FOOTWORK TECHNIQUE<br>
						The judge must asses the correct use of each part of the foot, posture movement and closing of the feet and the expression and control of foot movements.<br> <br>
